## 🔸 Download the excel file I prepared for you: 
[Excel_DataSource](./email_sender_datasource.xlsx)

- Open and review the Excel file (which has two sheets: "Customer Data" and "Sent Emails Data").
- Go to the "Customer Data" sheet.
- Fill in the columns: Email, Last Name, First Name, Gender.
- The script will automatically update the "Status" column to "Sent" after sending emails, don't fill in the column "Sent".
- Don't fill in the sheet "Sent Emails Data", the sheet will automatically update once your emails will be sent.
