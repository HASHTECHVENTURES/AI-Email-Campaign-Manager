time.sleep(60)  # Check every 60 seconds (conservative)
```

# In check_gmail_for_replies(), modify the date range:
month_ago = (dt.datetime.now() - dt.timedelta(days=30)).strftime('%d-%b-%Y')  # 30 days
week_ago = (dt.datetime.now() - dt.timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%d-%b-%Y')   # 7 days
```

### Email Filtering

]

```
**Solution**: Run aggressive scan or check Gmail permissions
